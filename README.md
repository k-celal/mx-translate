# Turkish NMT Data Preparation Module

This repository contains the module files used to create datasets for Turkish Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. The datasets are generated by translating English sentences to Turkish, utilizing the provided English sentence datasets.

## Overview

The module files facilitate the process of generating Turkish datasets for NMT models. It includes Python scripts that utilize translation libraries to translate English sentences into Turkish. These scripts are designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## Features

- **Translation Functionality**: The repository includes Python scripts that implement translation functionality using various translation libraries.
- **Batch Processing**: Scripts are optimized for batch processing, enabling efficient translation of large datasets.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling mechanisms are incorporated to manage exceptions during translation.

## Installation

To use the module, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Utilize the provided Python scripts to generate Turkish datasets from English datasets.

## Usage

The main functionality of the module is encapsulated in the Python scripts provided. These scripts take English text files as input and generate corresponding Turkish translations.

### Example

```python
MXTranslate(lines=lines, batch_size=1000, start_index=1188000)
```
